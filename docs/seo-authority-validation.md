<!-- Checklist to maintain link authority growth and coverage validation -->
# Authority Growth & Coverage Validation Playbook

## Backlink Outreach Framework
1. **Partner Co-Marketing**
   - Prepare a quarterly co-branded spotlight for Milwaukee, Sidchrome, GearWrench, Ingersoll Rand, and Warren & Brown.
   - Deliver ready-to-publish copy + hero imagery partners can host on their blogs/press pages.
   - Track earned links, anchor text, and referral traffic in the outreach sheet (tab: `Brand Spotlights`).

2. **Industry Directories & Associations**
   - Submit updated company listings to Master Plumbers, NECA, and Australian Construction Associations.
   - Confirm NAP (name, address, phone) consistency and request indexed profile pages.
   - Maintain a rolling list of submitted directories with submission date, approval date, and live URL.

3. **Customer Success & Case Studies**
   - Publish one trade case study per quarter on `blog.toolsaustralia.com.au` and pitch to trade news outlets.
   - Include embedded product links and membership CTA.

4. **Local Sponsorships**
   - Sponsor two community TAFE programs per year in exchange for website recognition and press coverage.

## Validation Cadence
1. **Weekly**
   - Monitor Google Search Console Coverage > Pages and `Discover` reports.
   - Refresh keyword ranking snapshot (top 10 terms) in the index tracker sheet.

2. **After Each Deployment**
   - Submit Search Console validation for resolved issue buckets (Coverage, Enhancements).
   - Re-fetch `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` from production to confirm changes are live.

3. **Monthly**
   - Run Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools (mobile + desktop) and record Core Web Vitals in the tracker.
   - Review backlink acquisitions and update the outreach sheet.

4. **Quarterly**
   - Audit competitor SERP snippets; update structured data or content if rich results lag behind.
   - Re-assess membership conversion paths and adjust internal linking where rankings slipped.
