# Admin — Backend

## Server-only code

[src/server/admin/](../../src/server/admin/):
- `chargePastDueShared.ts` — shared logic for past-due charge retry (used by single + bulk endpoints)
- (other shared admin code)

## Features

[src/features/admin/](../../src/features/admin/) — feature-modular admin code.

## Services

[src/services/admin/](../../src/services/admin/) — admin services:
- `MembershipAnalyticsService` — renewal, past-due, and cancellation metrics.
  - `getAnalyticsBundle(startDate, endDate, dateRange, options?)` — returns `MembershipAnalyticsBundle`. Accepts optional `{ membershipAsOfMode, asOfDate }`. When `membershipAsOfMode === "snapshot"` and `asOfDate` is set, `cancelledMembershipRevenueImpact` is computed from the snapshot row's `scheduledCancelCount × current catalog price` (snapshot date-lock approximation). The `cancellationsInRange` count is always live (delta query).
  - `getMembershipByPackageLive()` — live per-package counts.
  - `getMembershipByPackageLiveForSnapshot()` — four-count shape used by snapshot writer cron.
  - `getMembershipByPackageSnapshot(asOfDate)` — point-in-time counts from `MembershipDailySnapshot`; falls back to live data with `snapshotMissing: true` when no row exists.

## Routes

[src/app/api/admin/](../../src/app/api/admin/) — extensive route family. Includes:
- User management
- Payment events / refund replay
- Charge past-due (single + bulk)
- Error reports
- Contact submissions
- Partner applications
- Promo management
- Affiliate management
- Draw management
- Analytics dashboards (`/api/admin/dashboard/stats`)
  - `GET /api/admin/dashboard/stats`: accepts `dateRange`, `startDate`, `endDate`. When `membershipAsOfMode === "snapshot"`, standing cancellation count and revenue impact are sourced from the snapshot table; delta metrics (cancelledMemberships, renewals) remain live. Response includes `snapshotMissingForStanding: true` when a snapshot row is absent for the requested date.
- User metrics (`/api/admin/metrics/users`)
  - `GET /api/admin/metrics/users`: accepts `startDate`, `endDate`, `groupBy`, `daily`. Also accepts `dateRange` (forwarded to `parseAdminDashboardDateRange` to derive `asOfDate`). When the resolved `asOfDate` is non-null (snapshot mode), `membershipStatus.active/cancelled/pastDue` in the response are sourced from `MembershipDailySnapshot` for that date; `membershipStatus.renewed` remains a live range delta. If no snapshot exists for the date, live values from the User-loop are returned.

> _TODO: enumerate the exact subdirectories under api/admin/ and document each._

## Auth pattern

Every handler:
```ts
const session = await getServerSession(authOptions);
const adminCheck = requireAdmin(session);
if (adminCheck) return adminCheck; // 401/403
// ... admin work
```
